%Created by Neil Loychik, Los Alamos National Laboratory

% First part, create a mixture of two signals where the low frequency is
% Gausian, and the high-frequency is non-Gaussian. 

%The general statement is a random seed makes gaussian and non-Gaussian
%samples, which are applied to the time domain, and filtered. There are 5
%distinct zones:
%<20 Hz Noise
%20-180 Hz Gaussian
%180-220 Hz Mixing of Gaussian and Lognormal
%220-2000 Hz Lognormal 
%>3000 Noise

%With this model, we can a posterori claim that this is a mixture of
%Gaussian and non-Gaussian data bound by predetermined frequencies. This
%can therefore test the validity of a higher-order spectral density where
%it should show Gaussian behavior in the low-frequency morph into
%non-Gaussian in the high-frequency.

%After stabelizing (when variance is not near-zero) at ~30 Hz, skewness
%(Sx) stabelizes to 0 and the SSD reports 0 in the Gaussian regime. When
%the non-Gaussian signal is injected, skewness decreases as expected as
%shown by a negative SSD from 300-2000 Hz.

%After stabelizing, Gaussian shows no change in kurtosis (KSD=0) with
%frequencies from 30-200 Hz. In the non-Gaussian regime, kurtosis increases
%with frequency, inditige non-Gaussian behavior is increasing. 


%Observations:
%1) The PSD from the new theory and convention (Welch) are near-identical
%with some difference in the noise regions. This implies a derivative
%approach is valid, and substantiates the higher-order spectral densities. 

%2) The SSD and KSD have very eradic values below 23 Hz. This is because a
%normalized moment is calculated by dividing by variance. Variance in the
%noise regime is near-zero, so these values are invalid until sufficient
%variance exists in the signal. 

%3) A spectral desnity should be thought of the change in a statistic with
%frequency. Therefore, skewness and kurtosis do not change significantly in
%the Gaussian regime.

%4) Main Point
% Looking at the PSD alone, one would not know it is comprised of two
%different random processes. However, the higher-order spectral desnities
% show show decreases in skewness and increases in kurtosis with frequency.
% After the bandlimit, contributions drop to zero in the high-frequency
%noise regime. Thus, the higher-order spectral densities show where the
%non-Gaussian behavior come from as intended.
