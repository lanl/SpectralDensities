%ABSTRACT: This script calculates a spectral density in accordance with 
%"Spectral Densities: Statistics and Probability in the Frequency Domain."
%This algorithm was the subject of a patent filing, and after the filing
%released as part of a conference presentation and paper. 

%As described in the patent, the novelty of this method is the ability to
%compute higher-order spectral densities. Namely, the current "state of the
%art" is to compute a power spectral density (PSD) with algorithms like
%MATLAB's pwelch script, which only calculates a spectral density of power:
%[Gxx F]=pwelch(x,...);

%In comparison, this script calculates spectral densities of power
%(variance) and higher-order statistics of skewness, kurtosis, and the
%probability density. E.g.:

%[M, F, Gx, Sx, Kx, Px] = loychikSD( x, Fs, Fbe, xbin )
%Gxx(:,ii)=gradient(Gx,F); %PSD
%Sxx(:,ii)=gradient(Sx,F); %SSD
%Kxx(:,ii)=gradient(Kx,F); %KSD
%Pxx(:,ii)=gradient(Px,F); %PDSD

%The PSD (Gxx) calculated by either Welch's of this algorithm should be 
%equivalent. 

%This script outlines a functional approach and is not optimized for
%computational efficiency. Notable efficiency improvements would be
%parrallelization, filtering, variable inputs, and optimized bandwidth
%error.

%Due to computational intensity, this script only computes a single
%array (e.g. x(:,1) ) of data instead of an matrix (e.g. x(:,:)). 




% LOYCHIKSD
%Output
%M = Mean and standard moments of the data. Useful to justify unitary
%    [mean(x); var(x), skewness(x), kurtosis(x), moment(x,1); moment(x,2);
%     moment(x,3)]
%F - Frequency for the spectral density. Bin center.
%Gx - Integrated Power Spectral Density - PSD - Results are comparable to
%     the integral of the pwelch function in Matlab or the Daniel method.
%Sx - Integrated Skewness Spectral Density - SSD
%Kx - Integrated Kurtosis Spectral Density - KSD
%Px - Integrated Probability Density Spectral Density - PDSD


%Input
% x = data
% Fs = Sampling Frequency
% Fbe = Frequency bin edges. Easier to implement by defining the edges and
% computing the bin center F, than defining F and computing edges.
%xn = bins for the probability density
